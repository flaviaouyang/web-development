# HTTP

The server and the web browser communicate using the HTTP protocol.

- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML.
- HTTP follows a classical client-server model
  - a client opens a connection to make a request and wait till receives a response
- HTTP is a stateless protocol
  - the server does not keep any data between the two requests

## Overview

- Clients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages (as opposed to a stream of data).
- Messages sent by the client are called **requests**, and the messages sent by the server are called **responses**.
