# CSS Units

## Absolute units

- Units that are always the same, no matter the context
- Example: `px`, `in`, `cm`

## Relative units

- Units that change based on context
- Example:
  - `em` and `rem`: both font size units
    - `em` is relative to the parent element's font size
    - `rem` is relative to root font size
    - Rule of thumb: use `rem`

## Viewport units

- Units that relate to the size of the viewport
- Example:
  - `vh` and `vw`: height and width
