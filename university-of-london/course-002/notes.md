# Responsive Web Design

## Usability and user experience

- **Usability**: about how usable a website is:
  - efficient
  - memorable
  - learnable
- **User experience (UX)** is subjective: how the user feels about a website
  - Happy
  - frustrated
  - bored
- Know your audience
  - who is your user, then design for them

## Where can I go

- navigation
- site architecture: with sitemap
- Sitemap: a way to visualize the website
  - starts with home page `index.html`
  - create a hierarchy tree
- how people find where they are within the site: breadcrumb trails

## Guidelines for Design

- Two approaches:
  - Cognition/evidence-based principles
    - what is the information
    - how do we make the information clear
  - User-centric approaches
    - who are our users
    - what do they want
    - how do they get the information 
- User Experience First
  - UX must come before any code is written
  - UX must be consistent
- What's this for
  - when presenting information, visitors need to grasp what the information is
- Obfuscation vs Simplicity
  - no corporate annual reports
  - no confusing content padded by generic imagery
