# Frameworks and Pre-processors

## Frameworks

- Bootstrap and Tailwind are some examples of CSS frameworks.
- They package up commonly used CSS code for you.
- A CSS framework is ultimately just a bundle of CSS that you can use and access, using the classes defined by the framework.
- Drawbacks:
  - Template look
  - Process of overriding a framework's styling or debugging style issues can be difficult

## Pre-processors

- Pre-processors or pre-compilers are languages that help you write CSS more easily.
- They reduce code repition and provide all sorts of time-saving and code-saving features.
- Think of them as extensions to vanilla CSS that provide more functionalities like nesting, mixins, and variables.
- Example: Sass, less, and stylus
