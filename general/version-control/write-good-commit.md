# How to Write a Git Commit Message

## Convention

- Style
  - Markup syntax, wrap margins, grammar, capitalization, punctuation

- Content
  - What kind of information should the body of the commit message (if any) contain? What should it not contain?

- Metadata
  - How should issue tracking IDs, pull request numbers, etc. be referenced

## The seven rules of a great Git commit message

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
