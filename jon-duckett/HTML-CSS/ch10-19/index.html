        <p>“Let us do something, while we have the chance! It is not every day that we are needed. Not indeed that we
            personally are needed. 
            <span class="line-height">Others would meet the case equally well, if not better. To all mankind they were
            addressed, those cries for help still ringing in our ears! But at this place, at this moment of time, all
            mankind is us, whether we like it or not.</span>
            <span class="letter-spacing">Let us make the most of it, before it is too late! Let us
            represent worthily for one the foul brood to which a cruel fate consigned us! What do you say? It is true
            that when with folded arms we weigh the pros and cons we are no less a credit to our species.</span>
            <span class="word-spacing">The tiger bounds to the help of his congeners without the least reflexion, or else he slinks away into the depths of
            the thickets. But that is not the question. What are we doing here, that is the question. And we are blessed
            in this, that we happen to know the answer. Yes, in the immense confusion one thing alone is clear. We are
            waiting for Godot to come -- ”</span>
